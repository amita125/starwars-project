Star wars projects display the characters fetched from API and allow the user to select no more then 3 characters to download about their details as csv file.

As you lunch the app you would see a loader that displayes the fetch loading.  

**Tech Stack:** *JavaScript, Php- Codeigniter, Bootstrap, Jquery*

## <a name="user-stories">User Stories</a>
```As a user when i visit the app, I would like to see the visual loading percentage of data then the blak screen.
```
```
As a user I would like to be able to see specific number of character in a go rather then all the characters at once.
```
```
As a user, I would like to have a flexibility in selecting the character.
I expect to select maximum of 3 characters only and reset the selection with the button.
I expect to display the alert message when the user select more then 3 character.
```
```
As a user, I would like download the characters details based on the selection.
I expect the csv file to be downloaded in the device with the selected characters details.
